🚀 Guess what? I'm diving into my second data analytics project—let’s crunch some numbers and uncover cool insights together!

📅 Analyzing web page user conversation and drop-off activity Jan – Apr 2015 using PowerBI

💡 Goal: Apply skills gained through DataCamp’s PowerBI courses to deliver insights and drive strategic decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

🔹 PowerBI: Visualization & dashboard creation

📈 Skills Applied:

🔹 PowerBI: Data connection, Data cleaning, DAX formulas

🔹 Business acumen: Insightful summary & recommendations

🔍 Key Highlights:

🔹 452 users (0.5%) completed payment confirmation, while 89,900 (99.5%) dropped off.

🔹 Major drop-off points: search page (45K) and payment page (39K).

🔹 Desktop: Most users left at search page, but payment page drop-offs rose from 6.4K (Feb) to 7.3K (Apr).

🔹 Mobile: Search page drop-offs jumped from 1.5K (Feb) to 6K (Mar & Apr).

💸 Business Impact:

🔹 Conversions fell from 181/month (Jan–Feb) to 45/month (Mar–Apr).

🔹 Potential loss: $13.6K/month or $109K for the next 8 months (at $100/order).

✅ Recommendations:

🔹 Desktop: Improve search & payment stages.

🔹 Mobile: Focus on search experience.

🔹 Run A/B tests to find the best-performing website design.

🎯 Key Takeaway: Improving the search and payment pages, especially for mobile users, is crucial to reducing drop-offs and recovering lost revenue.
